This is the GEOS-Chem run directory for the 4x5 SOA simulation + PAH chemistry (PDI).  This directory
can be used with GEOS-5, GEOS-FP, MERRA, or MERRA-2 meteorology.

Photolysis and aerosol .dat input files are linked to ../chem_inputs/soa.
This allows us to keep a single set of these files in one location, for
convenience.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template also stored in
../chem_inputs/soa.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will be created from the
HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is run.

The HEMCO_config.rc in this run directory has PAH inventories added.
