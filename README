This is the GEOS-Chem run directory for the 4x5 SOA simulation.  This directory
can be used with GEOS-5, GEOS-FP, MERRA, or MERRA-2 meteorology.

Photolysis and aerosol .dat input files are linked to ../chem_inputs/soa.
This allows us to keep a single set of these files in one location, for
convenience.

The HEMCO configuration file is linked to HEMCO_Config.template also stored in
../chem_inputs/soa.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will be created from the
HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
